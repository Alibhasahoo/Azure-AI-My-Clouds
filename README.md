This repository contains two Python modules, azure_rest.py and sdk.py, which facilitate interactions with Microsoft Azure services. 
These modules provide examples of using both REST API and SDK approaches for managing Azure resources.

Files

â€¢ rest.py - A Python script to interact with Azure services via REST API calls.
It uses direct HTTP requests for granular control over API interactions.

* sdk.py - A Python script that leverages the Azure SDK for Python, simplifying
 interactions with Azure by using high-level, pre-built methods provided by the SDK.
